activity_overlap.py
=====================
Compares the DAILY ACTIVITY pattern of real Japanese camera triggers with
that of a simulated bear (the movement model of Fabian Breu, transferred to
the Japanese camera landscape), reduced to a single figure: the overlap
coefficient Delta, where 0 means no agreement and 1 means identical.

Why the data is pooled rather than analysed per camera: the real data holds
only 36 to 52 timestamps spread over 8 to 20 cameras, which is far too thin
for a distribution PER camera. Pooled over all cameras the sample is large
enough for a kernel density estimate, which still has to be interpreted
with caution.

Method:
  - Real detections: times of day from bears_images_unified, excluding the
    placeholder device IDs (199999, 999999), which most likely come from
    failed ID detection during the e-mail import.
  - Simulated detections: many Monte Carlo runs rather than the single run
    in japan_comparison.py. Each run places a virtual bear at a random
    camera location with random sex, age and season, in order to average
    over the unknown demography, and moves it according to the model.
    Whenever it comes within DETECTION_RADIUS_M of a camera, that counts
    as a virtual trigger and its time of day is recorded.
  - Both distributions of times are smoothed by circular density
    estimation (a wrapped Gaussian KDE, so that 23:00 and 00:00 are
    correctly treated as close together rather than at opposite ends of a
    line) and compared through the overlap coefficient
    Delta = integral(min(f1, f2)). This is the standard measure in the
    camera trap literature (Ridout and Linkie, 2009), rebuilt here on the
    same principle but without the von Mises kernel of the R "overlap"
    package.
  - Uncertainty: bootstrap resampling with replacement from both samples,
    recomputing Delta 1000 times, which yields a 95 % confidence interval
    instead of a single figure that would look unjustifiably precise.
