pages/2_Experiments.py
========================
Analysis page: movement animation of the Carpathian bears. The real GPS
route and several simulated bears advance along the same time axis (see
sync_simulation.py); the fan of candidate steps can be shown in addition.

Why SEVERAL simulated bears instead of one: each path is only one random
draw from the model. A single path next to the real route would be read
as "the model predicts this route", whereas several diverging paths show
the space of possibilities directly. The seed makes every run exactly
reproducible, which matters for figures.

The page is aimed at readers who want to follow how a particular bear
moved through the terrain on a particular day, and how plausible the
simulated alternatives are. Therefore:
  - filters for bear, season and day (only days WITH data are selectable)
  - the data source is shown explicitly (MariaDB or CSV fallback)
  - satellite imagery and optional 3D terrain for spatial context

Performance principle: only ONE day is loaded server-side, but at full
resolution without downsampling, rather than the complete multi-year
history.

    Load ONE day and compute the matching simulation, cached.

    Why this is cached: Streamlit re-executes the whole script on EVERY
    interaction. Without a cache, build_synced_geojson() ran again each
    time, the generated HTML of the map component changed, the iframe was
    rebuilt and the animation restarted from the beginning. With the
    cache, a rerun with unchanged parameters returns exactly the same
    result and the iframe stays in place.

    All inputs are scalar: the day is loaded INSIDE the function instead
    of passing the GeoJSON in as an argument. Otherwise st.cache_data
    would have to hash a dict with thousands of features on every rerun.

    seasons_key is a tuple, and therefore hashable, and deliberately part
    of the cache key: the season selection determines which points the
    day contains in the first place.

**The dataset.** GPS collar data from brown bears (*Ursus arctos*) in the
Romanian Carpathians: 13 individuals and 59,997 fixes, recorded from
9 August 2011 to 31 July 2015. Fix intervals are about one hour — 80% fall
between 0.9 and 1.1 hours, 13% around two hours, the rest longer. One bear on
one day is loaded at a time, at full resolution.

**What the colours mean.**

| Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Blue** dot and trail | The bear's actual recorded GPS track, interpolated between fixes. |
| **Orange** dots and trails | Simulated bears, generated by the movement model. Several are shown at once; each is a separate run. |
| **Grey** fan (optional) | At every real step, all candidate moves the model considered at that moment. |

**What the animation shows.** Real and simulated bears advance along the
*same* timeline, starting from the *same* position. Both are driven by the
timestamps of the real GPS track, so any separation you see between them
accumulated within that time window. The "Abstand ø" readout gives the current
mean distance between the real bear and the simulated ones.

**What it does not show.** The orange paths are **not predictions** and not a
reconstruction of anything the bear actually did. Each is one random
realisation drawn from the model: change the seed and you get different paths
from the same starting point. This is why several are drawn at once — the
spread between them is the meaningful part, not any single line. A simulated
bear ending up far from the real one is not in itself a modelling failure.

**The question behind it.** Given step lengths and turning behaviour learned
from real bears, does the model produce movement that is *plausible* for this
landscape and this time of year? The comparison is distributional — how far
bears travel, how tortuous their paths are — not a point-by-point match.

**Reproducibility.** Every run is identified by the short hash shown above the
map. The same bear, day, season selection, seed and settings always reproduce
exactly the same paths.
