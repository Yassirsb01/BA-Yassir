=============================
Japan experiment: one camera is selected, N simulated bears start there
at an actual photo event (place and time) and move according to the
Carpathian model (speed, optional terrain weighting, directional
persistence). Real photo times AT THAT CAMERA are marked as red ticks on
the same timeline, giving a direct visual comparison that requires no
statistical background to read: do simulated bears arrive at times
similar to the real sightings?

There is no "entire period" window as in the Carpathian animation: the
simulation has no natural end, only fixed windows from 15 minutes to
72 hours.

The Monte Carlo statistic (overlap coefficient with bootstrap confidence
interval over ALL cameras and runs, see activity_overlap.py) is kept but
moved into a collapsed section below. The animation answers the question
directly and without prior knowledge, so it comes first.

**The idea.** Movement patterns learned from GPS-collared brown bears in the
Romanian Carpathians are transferred to a camera-trap landscape in Japan
(Fukushima region, Honshu), where no collar data exists. The question is
whether simulated bears show up near cameras at times comparable to when real
photographs were actually triggered.

**Two very different kinds of data.** The Romanian data is tied to the
*animal*: a collar reports where one known bear is, hour by hour. The Japanese
data is tied to the *place*: a camera reports that some bear passed a fixed
point at a given moment, with no identity and no track. The two cannot be
compared directly — only through the timing and location of encounters.

**What the colours mean.**

| Element | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Coloured** dots and trails | Simulated bears. All start from the same real photo event — same place, same timestamp — and then move independently. |
| **Grey** dots | Camera locations. Click one for its device ID, coordinates and number of real photographs. |
| **Yellow** flash | A camera lights up when a simulated bear comes within the detection radius. |
| **Red** ticks on the timeline | Times at which a photograph was actually taken at the selected camera. |

**What the animation shows.** Whether simulated bears approach cameras during
the same hours of the day in which real photographs cluster.

In this dataset the triggers are strongly nocturnal: 47 of 50 usable
timestamps (94%) fall between 18:00 and 06:00. That concentration is itself an
observation, not a given. Asian black bears are generally described in the
literature as cathemeral — active during both day and night — so a near-absence
of daytime triggers is something the data shows rather than something the
species dictates. One plausible reading is avoidance of humans: these cameras
are placed at human–wildlife conflict sites, where daytime activity carries a
cost for the animal. With 50 timestamps the pattern is indicative, not
established.

**What it does not show.** Each coloured path is **one random realisation** of
the model, not a prediction of where a bear went. Re-running with a different
seed produces different paths. A single run proves nothing; the quantitative
answer comes from the statistical comparison further down the page, which pools
many runs across all cameras into an overlap coefficient with a confidence
interval.

**Known limitations.** The Japanese cameras lie in the range of the Asian black
bear (*Ursus thibetanus*), while the model was trained on European brown bears
(*Ursus arctos*) — a deliberate simplification, not an equivalence. The number
of real photo timestamps is small, so results are indicative rather than
conclusive. Terrain weighting, when enabled, uses OpenStreetMap land-use data
with hand-set preferences, not coefficients fitted to observed habitat use.
